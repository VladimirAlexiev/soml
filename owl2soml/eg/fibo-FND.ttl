There are two distinct kinds of concepts that correspond to money and amounts: a concrete, actual amount of money, and the monetary measure of something denominated in some currency.

The definition of currency provided herein is compliant with the definitions given in ISO 4217.  ISO 4217 provides universally applicable coded representations of names of currencies and funds, used internationally for financial transaction support.  The ontology has been partitioned into 2 parts: (1) the essential concept system describing the standard (this module), and (2) ISO4217-1-CurrencyCodes, which contains all of the individuals specified in ISO 4217.""" ;

		For securities the nominal value is often referred to as the face or par value. This is the redemption price of the security and is normally stated on the front of that security. With respect to bonds and stocks, it is the stated value of an issued security, as opposed to its market value.
		
		When applied to a swap this is the amount used for calculating the actual value of the interest due. Also known as Notional Value when describing derivative contracts in the options, futures, and currency markets, this term is often used to value the underlying asset in a derivatives trade. It can be the total value of a position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract.

		An example is that a firm might have a variable rate loan on $100,000 but decide to swap only $40,000. The $40,000 is the notional amount of the swap and becomes the amount on which interest is paid.""" ;

	fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote
		"""Agents, then, can be software agents, hardware agents, firmware agents, robotic agents, human agents, and so on.  While software developers naturally think of IT systems as being constructed of only software agents, a combination of agent mechanisms might in fact be used from shop-floor manufacturing to warfare systems.  The definition incorporated herein must be sufficiently general to account for these and other uses, such as for describing people and organizations who participate in broader processes and systems, for FIBO, other OMG standards and usage, and in general.

Whether or not you restrict your view of agents to the software variety, most agree that agents deployed for IT systems are not useful without the following three important properties:

(1) Autonomous - an agent is capable of acting without direct external intervention.  Agents have some degree of control over their internal state and can act based on their own experiences. They can also possess their own set of internal responsibilities and processing that enable them to act without any external choreography.  When an agent acts on behalf of (or as a proxy for) some person or thing, its autonomy is expected to embody the goals and policies of the entity that it represents.

(2) Interactive - an agent communicates with the environment and other agents. Agents are interactive entities because they are capable of exchanging rich forms of messages with other entities in their environment.  These messages can support requests for services and other kinds of resources, as well as event detection and notification.  They can be synchronous or asynchronous in nature.  The interaction can also be conversational in nature, such as negotiating contracts, marketplace-style bidding, or simply making a query.

(3) Adaptive - an agent is capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment. Agents can react to messages and events and then respond appropriately.  Agents can be designed to make difficult decisions and even modify their behavior based on their experiences.  They can learn and evolve.""" ,
		"Note that this does not necessarily imply that an agent is free to act as it sees fit, without constraint. Rather, an autonomous thing in the sense meant here is something which may or may not be subject to controls and constraints but is self-actualizing in its behavior in response to any such constraints. Autonomous things may include human beings, organizations, software agents, robots and animals."

The number will appear on an identity document issued by a country.

The ways in which such a system is implemented are dependent on the country, but in most cases, a citizen is issued an identification number at birth or when they reach a legal age (typically the age of 18). Non-citizens may be issued such numbers when they enter the country, or when granted a temporary or permanent residence permit.

Many countries issued such numbers ostensibly for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States originally developed its Social Security number system as a means of disbursing Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become utilized for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car.""" ;

   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
   (6) to revise a few of the definitions based on more formal sources.""" ,

		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Agreements/Contracts.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.""" ,

Dispute Resolution is uncontroversial, the question is whether there are other implications to Governing Law or if it's the same thing. For instance I may undertake to behave as though I were responsible to a particular authority i.e., a particular set of statutes." ;

		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates/ version of this ontology was revised to loosen domains on properties related to business day and day count (recurrence interval) conventions, eliminate a duplicate individual, normalize definitions to be ISO 704 compliant, eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC, move hasBusinessCenter to locations, where the class BusinessCenter is defined and merge countries with locations." ,
		"""This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification.  It is also needed to provide temporal relationships for Ownership and Control.

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

   * FinancialDates  -- financial Dates and Schedules
   * BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
   * Occurrences    -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them.  Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together."""

		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates/ version of this ontology was revised by the FIBO FND 1.2 RTF in order to introduce the definition of a time interval, which is a location, to ground some of the concepts such as a date period, and duration as well as to support the definition of business recurrence intervals for use in parametric schedules for securities." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/FinancialDates/ version of this ontology was revised to add the 'has date added' property, which is needed for the date a constituent is added to a basket, among other purposes, to add a TimeOfDay class, needed for representing rate reset times, eliminate duplication with concepts in LCC, and make AdHocScheduleEntry a child of DatedCollectionConstituent." ,

		"""This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification.  It is also needed to provide temporal relationships for Ownership and Control.

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

   * FinancialDates  -- financial Dates and Schedules
   * BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
   * Occurrences    -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them.  Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together."""

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

   * FinancialDates  -- financial Dates and Schedules
   * BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
   * Occurrences    -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them.  Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together."""

A common law system is a legal system that gives great potential precedential weight to common law, on the principle that it is unfair to treat similar facts differently on different occasions. The body of precedent is called common law and it binds future decisions. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (this principle is known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a matter of first impression), judges have the authority and duty to make law by creating precedent. Thereafter, the new decision becomes precedent, and will bind future courts."""

   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure

   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
   (6) to revise some of the text definitions using more formal sources."""

This class defines control as a kind of legal capacity, conferred on something by something via some formal means i.e. some instrument of control. When asserting that there is some de jure controlling interest (for example in some company by some other company) we do not at the same time assert the conclusions that would be drawn as a result of observing those controlling interests - that is covered under de facto control." ;

   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure

		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Places/Addresses.rdf version of this ontology was modified replace hasDefinition with isDefinedIn to clarify intent, and the address hierarchy was simplified to enable extensions for international and national delivery address specification, and to eliminate deprecated elements." ,

		"""The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/Foundations/20130601/Organizations/Addresses.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations
   (6) to move this ontology from Organizations to Places and eliminate unnecessary properties and related imports dependencies."""

		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Relations/Relations.owl version of the ontology submitted with 
the FIBO FND RFC, was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations
   (6) to move the ontology from the Utilities module to an independent Relations module
   (7) to revise a number of definitions, per discussion with various stakeholders.
   (8) to augment the definitions to include entity names from Business Entities.""" ,

Therefore this identity relationship has a range of Thing, but is modeled as a sub property of "identity" to make this conclusion explicit. Editorial Note: This is a relationship with the sense that some relative thing takes the form of something, but is distinct from the similar concept as applied to Asset, in which the thing which takes the form of some asset is owned by someone. Here it is a resource, irrespective of whether or by whom it is owned. Labeled as "takes material form" to disambiguate these two relationships.'@en ;

A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items - finding a single 'figure of merit' for these items - when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful 'average' to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5)." ;

	rdfs:comment "QName: NONE:" ;
	dct:abstract '''The Values ontology introduces a set of foundational classes that represent "values" as OWL classes where a value is an immutable piece of information without a specific lifetime or identity independent of the properties that have a value as their subject.  Subtypes of Value are intended to include semantic, business relevant classes that are not i
	ndependent, mediating or relative things. 
While Values as defined here, in some cases, seem to replicate XSD data types they are intended to use, extend and build-on XSD data types for "business meaningful values". 
Business meaningful values (which we will call "Business Semantic Values") are things like amount, name, postal address, mass, duration, currency and metrics - concepts that make sense in the business domain and are the types of properties of business entities, but not they are not business entities in themselves.  These values are the type (range) of properties that represent the qualities and characteristics of the entities in our business domain such as people, places, transactions and financial instruments. In contrast to semantic values, primitive datatypes, such as "Real", "Integer" or "String", frequently have no business meaning on their own.
As the intent of the Value classes is to capture business meaning, the Value classes are not intended to be used directly in domain models. Subclasses of Value classes that capture business semantics are intended for use in domain models. In other languages, such as UML, this intent to only use subclasses is known as an "Abstract" class.''' ;

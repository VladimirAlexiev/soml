      A Value is an immutable piece of information without a specific lifetime or identity independent of the properties that have such a value as their subject.  Subtypes of Value are intended to include semantic, business relevant types that are not independent, mediating or relative things. Value is not intended to be used directly (a concept known as "abstract" in other languages such as UML), but is intended to have subclasses that are used in domain models.
      All explicit triples which have a value instance as their subject (with the exception of annotations) are defined as part of the identity of the value instance. The set of such properties should be treated as immutable (not changed once the value is defined). All instances of Value with the same set of properties may be treated as equivalent. Note that while the above is not directly expressible in OWL, the above constraints and semantics of values are asserted by this specification. QName: NONE:Value

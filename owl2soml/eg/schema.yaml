  CreativeWorkSeries:
    descr: |-
      A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/ItemList">ItemList</a> which is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as tv, radio and games).<br/><br/>
      
      Specific subtypes are available for describing <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/TVSeries">TVSeries</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/RadioSeries">RadioSeries</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/MovieSeries">MovieSeries</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/BookSeries">BookSeries</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Periodical">Periodical</a> and <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/VideoGameSeries">VideoGameSeries</a>. In each case, the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/hasPart">hasPart</a> / <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/isPartOf">isPartOf</a> properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.<br/><br/>
      
      It is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate

      An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement, for example inclusion in a "critic's pick" blog, a

It can be considered the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/result">result</a> of an <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/EndorseAction">EndorseAction</a> in which the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/object">object</a> of the action is rated positively by
      some <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/agent">agent</a>. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Action">Action</a>.<br/><br/>
      
      An <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/EndorsementRating">EndorsementRating</a> may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,
      endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive

  speakable:
    descr: |-
      Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.<br/><br/>
      
      The <em>speakable</em> property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:<br/><br/>
      
      1.) <em>id-value</em> URL references - uses <em>id-value</em> of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>
      
      2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/cssSelector">cssSelector</a> property.<br/><br/>
      
      3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/xpath">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>
      
      For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this
      we define a supporting type, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification">SpeakableSpecification</a>  which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em> property

  temporalCoverage:
    descr: |-
      The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals">ISO 8601 time interval format</a>. In
            the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.
            Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".<br/><br/>
      
      Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated

      A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline">dateline</a> is a brief piece of text included in news articles that describes where and when the story was written or filed though the date is often omitted. Sometimes only a placename is provided.<br/><br/>
      
      Structured representations of dateline-related information can also be expressed more explicitly using <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/locationCreated">locationCreated</a> (which represents where a work was created e.g. where a news report was written).  For location depicted or described in the content, use <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/contentLocation">contentLocation</a>.<br/><br/>
      
      Dateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples: "BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.", "Paris, France", "December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington", "Beijing/Moscow", "QUEZON CITY, Philippines"

      The <em>speakable</em> property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:<br/><br/>
      
      1.) <em>id-value</em> URL references - uses <em>id-value</em> of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>
      
      2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/cssSelector">cssSelector</a> property.<br/><br/>
      
      3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/xpath">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>
      
      For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this
      we define a supporting type, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification">SpeakableSpecification</a>  which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em> property

            the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.
            Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".<br/><br/>
      
      Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated
